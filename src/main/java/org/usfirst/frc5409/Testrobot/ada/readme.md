ada3 - Adaptive Drive   Assist
                    |>  Alignment
                    |>  Avoidance  

ADA is basically just a concept name for any computer driven
control of the drivetrain that reacts to some real-world parameter.
ADA3 represents three types of program: assisting the driver,
aligning the drivetrain or avoiding obstacles.

FKBT - Forward Kinematic Blind Tracking

Utilizes a kinematic model of differential drive movement to
semi-accurately track the vehicles position over a small time 
period. Intended to be utilized while driving "blind," which
essentially means tracking the vehicle without any real-world
landmark to base position off of. Due to the fact that it
accumulates large ammounts of error over large distances, you
can only be "blind" for short periods of time, after which
a landmark position is detected and position is adjusted.

UNAlgo - Unammed Algorithim
Don't have a name for this algorithim yet, currently in
progress. TBD

DOP - Dynamic Object Perminance

SOP - Static Object Perminance
